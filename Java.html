    Java Programming at Wikibooks

    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
    implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers
    write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
    without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
    virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and
    C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as
    reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

    Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then.[18] Java
    was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.[19] Although still widely popular,
    there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining
    popularity.[20]

    Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun's
    Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were
    released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java
    Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle, which
    bought Sun in 2010, offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. However, the official reference implementation is
    the OpenJDK JVM, which is open-source software used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux
    distributions.

    Java 23 is the version current as of September 2024. Java 20 and 22 are no longer maintained. Java 8, 11, 17, and 21
    are long-term support versions still under maintenance
