    Scratch is a high-level, block-based visual programming language and website aimed primarily at children as an
    educational tool, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16.[9][10] Users on the site can create projects on the
    website using a block-like interface. Scratch was conceived and designed through collaborative National Science
    Foundation grants awarded to Mitchel Resnick and Yasmin Kafai.[11] Scratch is developed by the MIT Media Lab and has
    been translated into 70+ languages, being used in most parts of the world. Scratch is taught and used in
    after-school centers, schools, and colleges, as well as other public knowledge institutions. As of 15 February 2023,
    community statistics on the language's official website show more than 123 million projects shared by over 103
    million users, and more than 95 million monthly website visits.[12] Overall, over 1 billion total projects have been
    created (including unshared projects), with the site reaching its 1,000,000,000th project in April 2024.

    Scratch takes its name from a technique used by disk jockeys called "scratching", where vinyl records are clipped
    together and manipulated on a turntable to produce different sound effects and music. Like scratching, the website
    lets users mix together different media (including graphics, sound, and other programs) in creative ways by creating
    and "remixing" projects, like video games, animations, music, and simulations.[13]
